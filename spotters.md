Greetings to you, mobile developer.

## ðŸ“œ Identify new ecodesign rules

If you want to identify new best practices for iOS or Android, you need to browse the existing guides or invent new ones. Anyway, we recommend you to follow the process of this [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/4), under the supervision of a coach. The [builders team](builders.md#ecocode-mobile) will particularly benefit from the addition of detailed [observations](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/4/views/2).

Don't forget to check them against the [current rules catalog](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile).

## ðŸ’¯ Evaluate ecodesign rules
If you want to assess the relevance of a rule, you need to measure the power consumption of a program, with and without the code pattern in question. For the Android platform, you can use [PowDroid](https://gitlab.com/powdroid/powdroid-cli), a lightweight command line tool.
