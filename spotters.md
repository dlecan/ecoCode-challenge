### Whether you are a web or mobile developer, follow the instructions for your challenge: ecoCode or ecoCode Mobile

# ecoCode

Greetings to you, web developer.

## ðŸ“œ Identify new ecodesign rules

If you want to identify new best practices for iOS or Android, you need to browse the existing guides or invent new ones. Anyway, we recommend you to follow the process of this [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1), under the supervision of a coach. Populate "Candidate, Implementable, Hardly Implementable and Not Implementable" Column. The [builders team](builders.md#ecocode) will particularly benefit from the addition of detailed [observations](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/4/views/2).

Don't forget to check them against the [current rules catalog](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/RULES.md).
