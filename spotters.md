# ecoCode

Greetings to you, web developer.

## ðŸ“œ Identify new ecodesign rules

If you want to identify new best practices for iOS or Android, you need to browse the existing guides or invent new ones. Anyway, we recommend you to follow the process of this [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1), under the supervision of a coach. The [builders team](builders.md#ecocode) will particularly benefit from the addition of detailed [observations](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/4/views/2).

Don't forget to check them against the [current rules catalog](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/docs/rules/web-matrix.md).

## ðŸ’¯ Evaluate ecodesign rules
If you want to assess the relevance of a rule, you need to measure the power consumption of a program, with and without the code pattern in question. Please contact a coach to use [ETSDiff](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/ETSdiff) and try to experiment a quick test of the rule
