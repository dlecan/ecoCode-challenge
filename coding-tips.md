# Your work should be

### **Reusable**

Responding to the obligation of Open Source.

### **Standard**

Have a neutral code so you can reuse it everywhere.

### **Understandable**

Even without commenting, being explicit is always better than implicit.

### **Qualitative**

The devil is in the details, be sure to always add things that will save you time.

### T**estable**

Your functions and objects shouldn’t be too dependent on each other, you must be able to easily inject data as inputs for testing purposes

### **Simple**

Simplicity is always better than functionality. Your code has a goal, make it as simple as possible .

# Coding rules

### YAGNI

**You Ain't Gonna Need It** is a principle of programming that states that programmers should not add a function unless it is absolutely necessary.

### KISS

**Keep It Simple, Stupid**, or KISS principle, is a design guideline that advocates simplicity in design. Unnecessary complexity should be removed as far as possible. The idea is not to optimize anything until you have fully mastered a simple version of what you are creating.

### DRY

**Don't Repeat Yourself** is a computer programming philosophy of avoiding code redundancy throughout an application in order to facilitate maintenance, testing and debugging. 

# Basic Git commands for developers

### **#1 git init**

The git init command lets us create a new Git repository. This is the first command to start a new project in a GitHub repository. Go to the directory that contains your project files and run the **git init** command. A hidden .git subdirectory will be added to it.

### **#2 git clone**

git clone creates a local working copy of the source code from a remote repository. When you clone a repository, the code will be automatically downloaded to your machine.

This command will add the original location as a remote location so you can pull changes from it and push changes to it if you have the permission.

### **#3 git branch**

git branch lets us add a new branch to an existing branch, view all existing branches, and delete a branch.

### **#4 git checkout**

The git checkout command allows us to switch to an existing branch or create and switch to a new branch. To achieve this, the branch you want to switch to should be present in your local system and the changes in your current branch should be committed or stashed before you make the switch. You can also use this command for checking out the files.

### **#5 git add**

The git add command adds your changes in a file to the staging area where you can compare your local version and the version on the remote repository.

Before you commit your new or modified file, it should be added to the staging area by using the git add command.

### **#6 git commit**

git commit saves the changes in your local repository. Every time you commit your code changes, you have to include a brief description of the changes made. This commit message helps others understand the changes that have been done.

### **#7 git push**

The git push command pushes the committed file changes from the local repository to the remote repository so others can use them. It will also create a named branch in the remote repository if it does not exist.

### **#8 git pull**

git pull fetches the last uploaded changes from the remote server into the local repository so that you can have the latest updates from your teammates.

### **#9 git merge**

The git merge command merges your branch with the parent branch. The parent branch can either be a development or master branch depending on your workflow.

It will automatically create a new commit if there are no conflicts. Before running the git merge command, you should be on the specific branch you want to merge with your parent branch.

### **#10 git status**

git status provides an overview of the current status of your repository.
