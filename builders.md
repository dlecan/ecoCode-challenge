# ecoCode Mobile

Greetings to you, mobile developer.

## What's left to be done


## Contribute, but in the right way

Code quality is very important in this complex project. Each plugin (Android, iOS) works differently and you have to learn their coding style. Take a look at the [contributing file for the Android plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/ios-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [contributing file for the iOS plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/android-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md).
