# ecoCode Mobile

Greetings to you, mobile developer.

## What's left to be done

We keep the list of implemented versus non-implemented rules up to date. Take a look at the [remaining rules for the Android plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/android-plugin/RULES.md) or the [remaining rules for the iOS plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/ios-plugin/RULES.md). You don't have enough? Go and give a hand to the [spotters team](spotters.md#ecocode-mobile).

## Contribute, but in the right way

Code quality is very important in this complex project. Each plugin (Android, iOS) works differently and you have to learn their coding style. Take a look at the [contributing file for the iOS plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/ios-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [contributing file for the Android plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/android-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md).
