# Hello! Welcome to the builder team üëã

Interested in adding rules to one of the ecoCode plugins? You are at the right place.\
This guide will go through the **important elements** you might need for a successful challenge!

## üéí Starter pack

Follow [this complete guide](starter-pack-challenge.md) to get ready before the challenge starts!\
In case of difficulty or question about the installation procedure before the beginning of the challenge, you can [open a ticket here](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/issues).

## ‚úÖ What's left to be done

Here are the files containing the up to date list of rules to implement according to the chosen programming language:

- [Web rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/docs/rules/README.md)
- [Android (Java) rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/android-plugin/RULES.md)
- [iOS (Swift) rulles](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/ios-plugin/RULES.md)


Tasks are tracked via GitHub Kanban projects, with one task corresponding to one rule:

- [Kaban for web rules](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1)
- [Kaban for mobile rules](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/4)

You don't have enough rules? Go and give a hand to the [spotters team](spotters.md).

## üö¶ Contribute, but in the right way

It is best to first read the [common ecoCode contribution guide](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md).\
Code quality is very important in this complex project. Each plugin works differently and you have to learn their coding style.

For some languages, there are specific contribution guidelines. Follow the guides for the languages you are interested in below:

- Web: [JavaScript](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-linter/blob/main/eslint-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Mobile: [Android (Java)](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/android-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md) ‚Ä¢ [iOS (Swift)](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile/blob/main/ios-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md)


It's time for development, good luck builder! ‚öíÔ∏è
